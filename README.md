## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

It's my first time working with Sass. Most of my time was spent reading the documentation to see if I can do things differently than I normally do with pure CSS. My selectors ended up a bit more specific than I like, but I think it's okay.

I can definitely see the advantages of using Sass and I look forward to using more of it in future projects.
